# Qt-Tetris-for-win
My first QT project. It has a special double mode


 This is a Tetris which is different from the Tetris which is common in the markets. This one has a double mode which requires
 the two players to disturb each other and earn your own score. The one who has a better score can save his name and score in 
 a local file.
